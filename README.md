Project List
-----------------------------------------
A set of Projects and example code for the 20-pin, 8-bit PIC 16F18446 Microcontroller,
made by *Microchip*. 

This PIC can be programmed with the
DM164137 - Development Kit, Curiosity, Integrated Programmer/Debugger,
which supports 8/14/20 Pin 8-Bit PIC MCU's. 
The curiosity board was used as development board 
during the development of these programs.

Each Project has a short Readme, schematic and code files
in the relevant sub folder. All code is written in C(xc8 compiler)
